- Begin by thinking about how to set up the database models you are going to need to accomplish your goal.

- You will need users with:
  - full-names (first and last)
  - usernames (you can use email for this)
  - passwords
  - membership-status
- Users should be able to create messages that have
  - title
  - timestamp
  - some text
- Your database should keep track of who created each message.

# Implement messages saved on DB
